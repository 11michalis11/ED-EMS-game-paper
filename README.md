Paper on a game theoretic model of the behavioural gaming that takes place at the EMS - ED interface
=======================================================================
Overview
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
This paper investigates how we can model some of the behavioural gaming that 
takes place between the Emergency Department (ED) and the Emergency Medical
Services (EMS). A 3-player game is investigated that is informed by a queueing
theoretic model.
